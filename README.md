# Haversine implemented in Go

I finally found 20 minutes to have my first trial of the recent addition to Google's arsenal; Google Go. Having been working a lot with distances lately I decided to implement Haversine formula in Google Go, my next stop will hopefully be to tie this in with Google Maps API and trying to do something clever.
